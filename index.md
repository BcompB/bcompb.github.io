# Welcome to BcompB on GitHub

BcompB or the Bristol Computational Biochemistry group is a grouping of
University of Bristol researchers in Computational Biochemistry, in particular
in biomolecular simulation and computational biomolecular design. The group has
members across several Schools and Faculties, primarily in the faculties of
Science and Life Sciences. We meet up regularly to discuss topics of interest to
the group and host seminars in computational biochemistry.

# Computational Resources Created by Members of BcompB

This section contains a list of computational resources created by members of
BcompB. Check out the links for more information.

## BioSimSpace (Woods Group)

Available [here](https://github.com/michellab/BioSimSpace).

BioSimSpace is an interoperable framework for biomolecular simulation. With it
you can:

* Write robust and portable biomolecular workflow components that work on
  different hardware, with different software packages, and that can be run in
  different ways, e.g. command-line, [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org).
* Interact with running molecular simulation processes in real-time within a
  Jupyter notebook.

## BUDE (Sessions Group)

Available [here](http://www.bris.ac.uk/biochemistry/research/bude).

BUDE is a general purpose molecular docking program written in C++, OpenMP and
OpenCL that uses GPU acceleration to perform:

1. Virtual screening by docking of millions of small-molecule ligands
2. Ligand binding site identification on protein surfaces
3. Protein-protein docking in real space

## CCBuilder 2 (Woolfson Group)

Available [here](http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/ccbuilder2/builder)
([source](https://github.com/woolfson-group/ccbuilder2)).

CCBuilder 2 is an interactive web app for atomistic modelling of coiled coils
and collagens. It has a simple user interface for creating and evaluating
models that can be used in simulation, for solving structural data or for
aiding protein design.

## Elfin (Parmeggiani Group)

Available [here](https://github.com/joy13975/elfin).

Elfin is a computational protein design tool based on repeat protein module
construction. The main idea of Elfin is to use repeat proteins as rigid
construction modules (much like how Lego works) and build 3D shapes that are as
close to the user's input description as possible.

## Enlighten (van der Kamp Group)

Available [here](https://github.com/marcvanderkamp/enlighten/).

Protocols and tools to run (automated) atomistic simulations of enzyme-ligand
systems. For the PyMOL plugin, see
[here](https://github.com/marcvanderkamp/enlighten/blob/master/Pymol/README.md).

## ISAMBARD (Woolfson Group)

Available [here](https://github.com/isambard-uob/isambard).

ISAMBARD is a Python-based framework for structural analysis and rational design
of biomolecules, with a particular focus on parametric modelling of proteins.
