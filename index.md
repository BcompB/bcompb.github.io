# Welcome to BcompB on GitHub

BcompB or the Bristol Computational Biochemistry group is a grouping of
University of Bristol researchers in Computational Biochemistry, in particular
in biomolecular simulation and computational biomolecular design. The group has
members across several Schools and Faculties, primarily in the faculties of
Science and Life Sciences. We meet up regularly to discuss topics of interest to
the group and host seminars in computational biochemistry.

# Computational Resources by Members of BcompB

This section contains a list of computational resources created by members of
BcompB. Check out the links for more information.

## BUDE (Sessions Group)

Available [here](http://www.bris.ac.uk/biochemistry/research/bude).

BUDE is a general purpose molecular docking program written in C++, OpenMP and
OpenCL that uses GPU acceleration to perform:

1. Virtual screening by docking of millions of small-molecule ligands
2. Ligand binding site identification on protein surfaces
3. Protein-protein docking in real space

Interaction energies are calculated using an empirical free energy forcefield
developed here. These energies approximate binding free energies in units of
kJ/mol and are used both for pose and affinity prediction. The forcefield
comprises very soft-core potentials to accommodate geometrical approximations
inherent in the docking approach and is designed to give a better balance
between energetic interactions and shape matching than more traditional methods.

## Elfin (Parmeggiani Group)

Available [here](https://github.com/joy13975/elfin).

Elfin is a computational protein design tool based on repeat protein module
construction. The main idea of Elfin is to use repeat proteins as rigid
construction modules (much like how Lego works) and build 3D shapes that are as
close to the user's input description as possible.

## ISAMBARD (Woolfson Group)

Available [here](https://github.com/isambard-uob/isambard).

ISAMBARD is a Python-based framework for structural analysis and rational design
of biomolecules, with a particular focus on parametric modelling of proteins.
